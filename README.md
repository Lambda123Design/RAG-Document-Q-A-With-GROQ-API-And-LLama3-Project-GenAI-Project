# RAG-Document-Q-A-With-GROQ-API-And-LLama3-Project-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files of "RAG Document Q&amp;A With GROQ API And LLama3 Project", an GenAI Project

(i) Implemented an end-to-end RAG-based document Q&A system using Groq Cloud and open-source LLM models like LLaMA 3 and Gamma.

(ii) Developed a Streamlit web app where users can enter queries and view answers with relevant context from preloaded documents

(iii) Created vector embeddings of PDFs using HuggingFace embeddings and stored them in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.

(iv) Designed a prompt template to guide the model to provide accurate responses based on document context.

(v) Integrated Groq API to interact with LLMs, enabling real-time query responses with response time tracking.

(vi) Demonstrated document similarity search, allowing users to see which parts of the documents contributed to the answers.
